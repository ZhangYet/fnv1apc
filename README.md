fnv1apc
=======

## Why this package

    carbon-c-relay use fnv1a to get the hash of a metric. But it use some magic number and C trick, so hard to translate into python. As a result I wrap the function in carbon-c-relay with [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/), which is AWESOME!!!!

## TODO

    [*] ditribute it on pypi
